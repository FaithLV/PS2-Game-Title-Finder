# PS2 Game Title Finder

Simple tool (written in c#) I created while trying to find a way for Spectabis to learn a games' name just from iso file. With this tool, you can find PS2 game title & serial number just from the image file. Uses 7ZipSharp for arhive discovery and GameIndex from PCSX2.

GameIndex not included. (Download PCSX2 and use)
